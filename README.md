# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. It allows you to play against the computer in a quick and fun match.

## How to Play
* Run the script.
* You'll be prompted to enter your choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
* The computer will randomly select its choice.
* The winner will be determined based on the game rules:
Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins)
Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
If both the player and computer choose the same, it's a tie.
* You'll be asked if you want to play again.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

app.py
